# 🚀 Agent Creator - Usage Guide

## Production-Ready AI Research & Web Scraping Platform

This application is **fully functional and production-ready**. All components have been tested and verified to work correctly.

---

## 🎯 Quick Start

### Option 1: Python Server (Recommended)
```bash
python3 start_server.py
```

### Option 2: Bash Script
```bash
./start_server.sh
```

### Option 3: Direct Streamlit
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## 📂 File Organization

The application automatically organizes research files:

- **Automatic**: Files are organized when you initialize agents in the app
- **Manual**: Run `python3 move_research_files.py` anytime
- All files starting with `research_` are moved to the `research/` directory

## 🔬 Research Agent Features

### Core Functionality
- ✅ **Web Search**: DuckDuckGo integration with fallback handling
- ✅ **Content Analysis**: AI-powered summary generation  
- ✅ **PDF Reports**: Professional research reports with citations
- ✅ **Jupyter Notebooks**: Interactive analysis notebooks
- ✅ **File Management**: Automatic organization and sanitization

### Fixed Issues
- ✅ **No more NoneType errors**: Robust error handling with fallbacks
- ✅ **No more directory issues**: Proper path validation and creation
- ✅ **No more research_https directories**: Filename sanitization prevents injection
- ✅ **Reliable file generation**: All files are created in the correct locations

### Example Usage
```python
# The research agent works with queries like:
"Evolution of Software Engineering of the next 5, 10, and 15 years"
"Latest developments in artificial intelligence"
"Machine learning trends and applications"
```

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. **Start the server**:
   ```bash
   python3 start_server.py
   ```

2. **Open your browser** to `http://localhost:8501`

3. **Initialize agents** using the sidebar button

4. **Start researching**:
   - Enter your research query
   - Configure options (PDF, notebook generation, etc.)
   - Click "Start Research"

5. **View results**:
   - Research files are automatically organized in `research/`
   - Download generated PDFs and notebooks
   - View analytics and results in the app

## 💡 Tips

- **File Organization**: The app automatically organizes files, but you can run `move_research_files.py` manually anytime
- **Multiple Queries**: You can run multiple research queries - each generates unique timestamped files
- **Error Recovery**: If something fails, check the error message and try again - the system is designed to be resilient
- **Resource Usage**: The system handles rate limiting and fallbacks gracefully
