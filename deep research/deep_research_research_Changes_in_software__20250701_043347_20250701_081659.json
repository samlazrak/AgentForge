But with artificial intelligence (AI) and automation now seamlessly integrating into the software development process, the progress is faster than ever.\nTable of Contents\nKey TakeawaysAI steps in: Coding smarter, faster, and cheaperAI automating software developmentCoding and programmingTesting and quality assuranceSoftware documentation & maintenanceDeployment, Operations, and MonitoringThe continued need for software engineersWhy software engineering roles will remain keyArchitecting SystemsSpecialized Domain KnowledgeManaging AI ComplexityCreativity, Ethics, and Legal ComplianceThe Human TouchFuture opportunities for software engineersBecoming AI/ML DevelopersSpecializing in CybersecurityBridging IT/OT Convergence\nThis shift brings crucial questions to the forefront: How will AI reshape the future of software engineering? Will human engineers remain essential, or could they be replaced by smarter, faster, and more efficient AI-driven systems? In this article, we assess the threat and opportunity of AI on software engineering services in 2025 and onwards.\nKey Takeaways\nCoding, testing, documentation, and monitoring tasks will be automated by AI, which will threaten many routine engineering roles.\nSoftware complexity is growing at a speed that no AI can handle alone at the moment. Human creativity, ethics, and versatility still rule.\nDomain specialization, architecting, and managing AI complexity will continue to be human-led and will be even more critical.\nFuture opportunities lie in acquiring AI, security, and hardware skills. Bridging IT/OT and leading collaboration will also be essential.\nAI steps in: Coding smarter, faster, and cheaper\nAI is changing how software is built by automating coding, testing, and debugging—tasks that used to require human effort. Global spending on AI software is expected to reach $632 billion by 2028, growing 29% annually from 2024. AI tools are already capable of writing code, running QA tests, and spotting bugs efficiently.\nBy 2025, AI will take on more advanced work, like writing optimized code, managing deployments, and automating routine tasks. Tools such as self-driving IDEs and smart coding assistants are becoming more common, using large datasets to improve results. Google’s CEO recently shared that 25% of the company’s internal code is now written by AI, showing how quickly these tools are being adopted.\nThe benefits are faster development, fewer errors, and lower costs. Engineers can spend more time on creative problem-solving while relying on AI for repetitive tasks. However, this shift raises concerns about how traditional roles will adapt as AI takes on a bigger role in software development.\nAI automating software development\nAI can now automate parts of the software lifecycle that previously required human effort. Below are key areas where AI could replace engineers by 2024:\nCoding and programming\nAI code generation tools are advancing quickly. Algorithms can now write complete programs in multiple languages based on simple commands or prompts. By 2024, AI could automatically generate simple business apps, websites, scripts, IoT systems, and data pipelines with minimal or no human input. Complex projects might also integrate machine-generated code.\nImpacts: Mid-tier developers who build standardized apps face the greatest risk, as AI could automate much of their work. However, elite engineers could use AI tools to code faster and more efficiently.\nTesting and quality assurance\nTesting and bug detection are highly suited for automation. AI testing tools already analyze codebases and model behaviors using machine learning to identify defects missed by human developers. In the future, smart systems will simulate user environments and generate test data to catch corner case bugs and security flaws.\nImpacts: Manual testers are most at risk as AI tools deliver higher coverage and faster results. Engineers may spend more time building rather than testing.\nSoftware documentation & maintenance\nAI can generate documentation and diagrams from system code and architecture with increasing accuracy. Bots can handle simple maintenance tasks like updates, integrations, and parameter changes, freeing up engineers’ time. AI could also create self-adapting, self-documenting software systems.\nImpacts: Technical writers and engineers focused on documentation and maintenance may fa...\n[Content truncated]",

Based on current trends and technological trajectories, here's how AI agents may transform development practices by 2025.\nAutonomous Project Generation\nGPT Pilot, currently handling basic application generation, signals a shift toward more comprehensive project automation. By 2025, such tools may evolve to handle increasingly complex architectures and automatically implement industry best practices. The interactive dialogue feature will likely become more sophisticated, potentially offering architectural decisions based on scalability requirements and maintenance considerations.\nPredictive Maintenance Revolution\nSWE-Agent's current capability to handle GitHub issues autonomously represents just the beginning. The next evolution may include predictive maintenance, where AI agents identify potential issues before they become problems. These agents might analyze code patterns, dependencies, and runtime behaviors to suggest optimizations and security improvements proactively, rather than just responding to reported issues.\nContext-Aware Intelligence\nWhile Blackbox AI currently offers contextual code completion, future versions of such tools may develop deeper understanding of entire codebases. We might see AI assistants that can explain architectural decisions, suggest refactoring opportunities, and automatically document code changes while maintaining consistency with existing documentation and coding standards.\nEmerging Trends to Watch\nIntegration of multiple AI agents working in concert\nEnhanced security analysis and vulnerability prediction\nAutomated code optimization for performance and efficiency\nReal-time collaboration between human developers and AI agents\nSophisticated testing and quality assurance automation\nChallenges and Considerations\nDespite these advances, the role of human developers will remain crucial. The challenge lies in developing AI tools that enhance rather than replace human creativity and problem-solving. Teams will need to adapt their workflows to effectively collaborate with AI agents while maintaining code quality and security standards.\nFor teams looking to prepare for these changes, exploring current AI development tools provides valuable insight into emerging capabilities and integration approaches. The key to success will likely be finding the right balance between AI automation and human oversight.\nAs these technologies mature, we may see a shift in developer roles toward higher-level system design and AI tool orchestration, while routine coding tasks become increasingly automated. This evolution could lead to faster development cycles and more reliable code, fundamentally changing how software is created and maintained.\nTop comments (0)\nTrusted User\nCreate template\nTemplates let you quickly answer FAQs or store snippets for re-use.\nCode of Conduct\nReport abuse\nAre you sure you want to hide this comment?

How will AI adoption change coding and what is the future of software engineering? Jalasoft’s experts dive into the possibilities that AI brings. Read now! Jalasoft's Editorial Team7 min reading6/30/2025Article Contents1. The Birth of Prompt Engineers2. AI Can Write Your Code… Should It?3. Educating the Next Generation of Engineers4. Conclusion: Skeptic but preparedThe demand for software engineers has dropped significantly in the past few years. According to a story published by The Washington Post in 2024, “More than a quarter of all computer programming jobs have vanished in the past two years.” They, like many others, attributed this decline to the rise of artificial intelligence. We know everyone has questions, and many have made big promises, but the truth is: there is little certainty. Whilst it is true that AI has made immense progress in the past few years, we don’t really know how it will continue to evolve or the consequences of that evolution. The way we see it, there are two scenarios: In the first, AI continues to evolve and improve at the current exponential rate. This would mean that anyone could code in human language. To understand the implications of this, it’s important to realize that the history of coding is all about levels of abstraction. Software development started with binary code, zeros, and ones. Years later, it moved into machine code, then assembly, followed by C, C++, and finally Python and JavaScript.  As coding evolved, languages became easier and more human-like. In this scenario, AI becomes the next level of abstraction.  However, technical human knowledge will still be needed, although less of it. And these engineers will still need to know how to code, because obviously, project managers won’t be able to handle that. (Want to understand Generative AI? Read our blog post: What is Generative AI? A Comprehensive Guide to this Cutting-Edge Technology)In the second scenario, AI doesn’t improve as much as we thought it would. Driven by the hype, most companies will have shifted to mostly AI-generated code, laid off most of their developers, and kept a few to manage the AI tools. Years later, problems start to surface, vulnerabilities, bugs, and issues caused by underperforming code. Then companies will have to backtrack to 80 percent AI code and bring engineers back to clean it up. This year, we’ve seen companies trying to keep up with the turmoil of change, responding with massive layoffs and bold new product offerings. In many ways, they’re placing bets on what they think the future will look like. Take Globant as an example: they recently launched their “AI Pods,” which promise faster coding powered by agentic AI, supervised by humans. Moves like this reflect a broader trend: companies are gambling on which scenario will prevail and reshaping their teams and strategies accordingly. Alternatively, Keller’s “AI & Machine-Learning Talent Gap 2025” report highlights a dramatic 61% jump in global AI/ML job postings in 2024, far outpacing other tech roles. Despite this surge, there’s a projected 50% hiring gap, meaning demand for skilled professionals is roughly double the available supply.  Simply put: good developers are scarce and expensive. But that doesn’t mean the best engineers have to come with the highest price tag. Several factors contribute to the cost-efficiency of a software engineer for a U.S. company, and nearshoring is one of the most strategic advantages. Take Latin America for example. While companies in countries like Argentina (such as BairesDev or Globant) have traditionally been go-to options, their rising costs—driven by exchange rate shifts and inflation—are making them significantly more expensive than they used to be.  In contrast, partnering with a Bolivian-based company like Jalasoft offers U.S. companies a far more cost-effective alternative without compromising on talent quality. With a robust in-house training system, Jalasoft delivers top-tier engineers who are not only affordable but also bilingual, culturally aligned, and time zone compatible. The Birth of Prompt Engineers The role of the human developer - said Thomas Dohmke, chief executive of GitHub, the Microsoft-owned developer site, to The New York Times - becomes to guide and direct the A.I. agents, like “the conductor of an A.I.-empowered orchestra.” As AI tools like ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, and Claude become more advanced, we’re witnessing the emergence of a new role in the tech industry: prompt engineers. These conductors of A.I.-empowered orchestras specialize in crafting clear, strategic prompts that guide large language models (LLMs) to produce useful, accurate, and high-quality outputs.  It would be a big mistake to assume, however, th...\n[Content truncated]",

New language models pop up daily; GitHub is rife with repos leaning into burgeoning AI technology; Silicon Valley startups quickly see multi-billion-dollar valuations thanks to their unique spins on AI.\nMake no mistake: AI is tech’s newest bubble. As with the dot-com boom a generation ago, the bubble will eventually deflate, leaving behind useful technology and a handful of companies smart and tough enough to have weathered the market. We spoke to experts to determine what tech pros should expect from the AI market in 2025 and beyond.\nWhat three changes do you see AI having for engineers and developers before the end of 2025?\nHow will engineers and developers use AI in five to 10 years?\nWhat are the pitfalls of using AI as an engineer/developer?\nIs there an ethical line engineers and developers should consider when using AI?\nWhat three changes do you see AI having for engineers and developers before the end of 2025?\nThe next year promises to be a big one for AI. Though none of the tech pros we spoke with see world-shattering changes in the near term, AI is expected to prove its mettle in 2025.\n“By 2025, AI will reshape the role of developers in ways that blend creativity with efficiency,” notes Charlie Clark, founder at Liinks and former Senior Software Engineer at Squarespace.\n“First, AI will become the ultimate coding assistant—not just generating snippets but translating high-level concepts into executable code. It will handle the heavy lifting of syntax, allowing engineers to focus on the 'why' rather than the 'how.' This shift will empower developers to create faster without sacrificing quality.\n“Second, AI will transform code maintenance. Today, sifting through legacy code is a time-consuming burden, but AI will be able to understand the logic of old systems, refactor them, and even update entire libraries seamlessly.\n“Finally, AI-driven automation in CI/CD pipelines will become the norm, optimizing build times and deployment processes based on past performance, making iterative development smoother. It’s not about replacing developers; it’s about letting them do what they do best—solve complex, meaningful problems.”\nSai Chiligireddy, Amazon’s Software Development Manager for Alexa, tells Dice: “AI-powered coding assistants like GitHub Copilot, CodiumAI, and Amazon Q are becoming increasingly sophisticated, with the ability to understand an entire codebase and its surrounding context deeply. These assistants can explain the functionality of specific code segments and provide insights into the overall code flow and architecture. Their capabilities go far beyond syntax checking—they can generate code snippets on demand.\n“For example, if an engineer needs to create an Amazon SQS client or set up an AWS EC2 instance, they can prompt the AI assistant, and the code will be generated automatically. These assistants can also detect patterns in the codebase, such as an SQS trigger for an AWS Lambda function, and proactively create the necessary code, permission groups, and associated triggers with minimal manual intervention. While the percentage of auto-generated code making it to production has room for improvement, I expect this to reach a good number, making the coding assistants much more reliable.”\nChiligireddy also sees AI becoming more valuable as a tool for software maintenance, adding: “By the end of 2025, I anticipate that AI assistants will be able to autonomously detect the need for upgrades or security patches, make the necessary changes, and seek approval, streamlining the entire maintenance workflow. Additionally, these AI-powered tools will be able to automatically generate comprehensive documentation and create test cases, further reducing the burden of software maintenance on engineering teams.”\nHow will engineers and developers use AI in five to 10 years?\nBeyond 2025, what do the next five to ten years look like for developers and engineers?\n“2024 is already being called the year of AI agents,” Chiligireddy adds. “In the next five to ten years, I anticipate engineers will have access to a suite of specialized AI agents, each focused on a specific domain—one for project planning and risk management, another for design and architecture, a third for coding and optimization, ...\n[Content truncated]",

Its influence spans the entire Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC), moving beyond simple task automation to become a collaborative partner for development teams. Primarily driven by advancements in Machine Learning (ML), Natural Language Processing (NLP), and particularly Generative AI (GenAI), AI tools are accelerating development timelines, automating repetitive tasks like code generation and testing, and enhancing developer productivity. Reports indicate significant adoption rates, with Gartner predicting 75% of enterprise software engineers will use AI coding assistants by 2028.However, this transformation is not without significant challenges. Concerns regarding the quality, security, and maintainability of AI-generated code are paramount. Studies suggest that while AI boosts speed, it can introduce subtle bugs, security vulnerabilities (like SQL injection or hardcoded secrets), and contribute significantly to technical debt if not managed properly. The \"black box\" nature of some AI models also raises issues of transparency and explainability (XAI), necessitating new approaches to ensure trust and accountability.The impact on software developers is profound, shifting the role from primarily manual coding towards orchestrating AI, validating outputs, and focusing on higher-level tasks like system architecture, complex problem-solving, and strategic thinking. While AI is augmenting developer capabilities rather than replacing them wholesale, upskilling in areas like AI literacy, prompt engineering, data analysis, ethical AI principles, and collaboration is critical. The job market outlook remains strong for software developers, with the US Bureau of Labor Statistics projecting much faster than average growth, partly driven by the need to develop and maintain AI systems themselves.For businesses, successfully leveraging AI requires a strategic, holistic approach. This involves identifying clear use cases aligned with business objectives, selecting appropriate tools (considering factors like open-source vs. proprietary models), and implementing robust governance frameworks to manage risks related to data privacy, security, bias, and intellectual property. Measuring the Return on Investment (ROI) necessitates looking beyond simple productivity metrics to include impacts on code quality, maintainability (technical debt), innovation speed, and developer satisfaction, potentially using frameworks like DORA. Effective change management, fostering a culture of learning and experimentation, and continuous monitoring are crucial for successful AI integration.The AI tooling landscape is diverse and rapidly evolving, featuring coding assistants (e.g., GitHub Copilot, Tabnine, Amazon Q Developer), automated testing tools, and AI-enhanced project management platforms. Strategic selection and governance of these tools are vital. Ultimately, the future points towards a symbiotic relationship between human developers and AI, demanding adaptation, strategic planning, and a commitment to responsible innovation.I. Introduction: AI's Ascendancy in Software DevelopmentThe landscape of software development is undergoing a period of unprecedented transformation, driven largely by the accelerating integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Once confined to niche applications or theoretical discussions, AI has rapidly matured into a practical and increasingly indispensable force across the entire software creation process. Understanding this shift requires a clear definition of AI within this specific context and an appreciation for the speed and breadth of its adoption.A. Defining AI in the Software ContextAt its core, Artificial Intelligence refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, particularly computer systems. In the realm of software development, this translates to leveraging technologies that enable computers to perform tasks traditionally requiring human cognition, such as learning, reasoning, problem-solving, understanding language, and even generating creative outputs.Key AI technologies underpinning this revolution include:...\n[Content truncated]",

As we look toward the innovations that 2025 might bring, it is a sure bet that GenAI will continue to change how we do software engineering.It’s hard to believe that just over two years ago in November of 2022 was ChatGPT’s first release. This was the point when large language models (LLMs) started to get widespread adoption. Even though LLMs are built in a surprisingly simple way, they produce impressive results in a variety of areas. Writing code turns out to be perhaps one of their strongest points. This is not all that surprising, given how:Programming involves far simpler grammar than any human languageThere is a massive amount of high-quality training data for these LLMs to use, in the form of working source code, thanks to open source software and crawling GitHub and other free-to-access code repositories (this kind of crawling and training is happening, regardless of whether it is ethical or not)Last year, we saw that about 75% of developers use some kind of AI tool for software engineering–related work, as per our AI tooling reality check survey. And yet, it feels like we’re still early in the tooling innovation cycle, and more complex approaches like AI software engineering agents are likely to be the center of innovation in 2025.Mainstream media has been painting an increasingly dramatic picture of the software engineering industry. In March, Business Insider wrote about how “Software engineers are getting closer to finding out if AI really can make them jobless”, and in September, Forbes asked: “Are software engineers becoming obsolete?” While such articles get wide reach, they are coming from people who are not software engineers themselves, don’t use these AI tools, and are unaware of the efficiency (and limitations!) of these new GenAI coding tools.But what can we realistically expect from GenAI tools for shaping software engineering? GenAI will change parts of software engineering, but it is unlikely to do so in the dramatic way that some previous headlines suggest. And with two years of using these tools, and with most engineering teams using them for 12 months or more, we can shape a better opinion of them.Addy Osmani is a software engineer and engineering leader, in a good position to observe how GenAI tools are really shaping software engineering. He’s been working at Google for 12 years and is currently the Head of Chrome Developer Experience. Google is a company at the forefront of GenAI innovation. The company authored the research paper on the Transformers architecture in 2017 that serves as the foundation for LLMs. Today, Google has built one of the most advanced foundational models with Gemini 2.0 and is one of the biggest OpenAI competitors.Addy summarized his observations and predictions in the article The 70% problem: Hard truths about AI-assisted coding. It’s a grounded take on the strengths and weaknesses of AI tooling, one that highlights fundamental limitations of these tools, as well as the positives that are too good to not adopt as an engineer. It also offers practical advice for software engineers from junior to senior on how to make the most out of these tools. With Addy’s permission, this is an edited version of his article, re-published, with more of my thoughts added at the end. This issue covers:How developers are actually using AI. Very different usages for “bootstrappers” versus “iterators.” Perhaps a reason why one tool is unlikely to work equally well for both groups?The 70% problem: AI's learning curve paradox. Lesser-talked-about challenges with AI: the “two steps back paradox,” the hidden cost of “AI speed,” and the “knowledge paradox.”What actually works: practical patterns. AI-first draft, constant conversation, and “trust but verify” patterns.What does this mean for developers? Start small, stay modular, and trust your experience.The rise of agentic software engineering. A shift to collaborating with AI, multi-modal capabilities, autonomous but guided approaches, and an “English-first” deve...\n[Content truncated]",
